# BringCloser

## What is the code for?

This the app of Capstone project at Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree of which mission is to help you remember all your memories relating to your close people. 
Fresh up your and your close people’s lives by giving and/or receiving:
- wish on a specific occurrence (e.g. birthday, name day, international women’s day, mother’s day,
        father’s day, etc.)
- reminder on a scheduled event (e.g. school leaving exam, interview for
        the dream job, etc.)
- private thought on a key happening (e.g. first date, first
        anniversary, first flowers to buy someone, etc.)

Besides the app, there is a home screen widget available for the user. This shows the received memories from her/his close people.
